# MangaMerger
Small desktop application to merge manga directories into Volume .cbz files for e-reader use. Simply paste in the file path of the folders containing the volumes and press go! Create a header level folder with the manga name, and sub folders for each chapter. Chapter folders should be labeled as "Vol.XX Ch.XX - Title". This will result in the application creating .cbz files titled "Manga Name Vol.XX.cbz"
